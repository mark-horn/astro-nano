I started as an intern where I had the awesome opportunity to work at the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, China. I had so much fun that I came back and worked a couple of contracting jobs with the Department of State. I eventually ended up on a cloud development gig where my team deployed the DECCS system for the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC). That's where I fell in love with software development and I wouldn't be where I am today without that experience.
