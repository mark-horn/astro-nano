[Work in Progress - as I am still reading Mr. Hamming's text]

What is necessary to do first-class work? Richard Hamming worked with Shannon, The father, of information theory, and discuss in ["You and your research"](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) how to properly become a great researcher.

1. Have courage

> Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can

Modern society could point this as a coach sentence. Can we doubt of Mr. Hamming intentions?

> Courage is one of the things that Shannon had supremely. [...] That is the characteristic of great scientists; they have courage. They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think.

2. Early recognition sterilizes
    - You can't work on smaller projects after huge achievements

3. "Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest" Bode

4. Real scientists have a collection of problems in their mind
