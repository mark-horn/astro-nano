Unfortunately, I haven't passed an interview lately. I was really excited about it. 

## Lessons

1. Keep the mind sharp, especially on the fundamental (mathematical for this role) concepts;
    - Constantly review basic concepts, especially the ones you cite on your CV
    - You need to be capable of explaining your ideas clearly to others;
2. There are no second chances if you are having a bad day or too nervous during the interview;
    - You need to overcome this fear and present your best;

## Thoughts

I believe that, in order to pass interviews, the hiring side needs to feel that I am the perfect candidate. This can be achieved when the whole interview process is sequential strikes, just as if you were playing bowling. At least hit the strikes when talking to the important people, such as the ones that you will be working with. They need to like you and like you more than the competitors.

```The funny thing is that the interview that I was refused was for an entry-level position. Competition has been so ~fucked up~ that early-stage careers are already at a level that you need to impress your seniors, by knowing more or as much as them.```

## Actions

1. Think ahead and be prepared for obvious questions but also possible questions related to the role;
    - I don't think it is impossible to predict such things;
    - As long as you don't predict everything wrong your preparation will still be valid;
2. Read as much as you can to be sharp (technical, non-technical)
3. Write more to improve the way you share your ideas;
